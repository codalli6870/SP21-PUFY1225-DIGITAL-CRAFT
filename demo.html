			<h2>Your place to talk</h2>
			<p class="paragraphs"> Whether you’re part of a school club, gaming group, worldwide art community, or just a handful of friends that want to spend time together, Discord makes it easy to talk every day and hang out more often.</p>

			<h2>An invite-only place with plenty of room to talk</h2>
			<p class="paragraphs"> Discord servers are organized into topic-based channels where you can collaborate, share, and just talk about your day without clogging up a group chat.</p>

			<h2>Where hanging out is easy</h2>
			<p class="paragraphs"> Grab a seat in a voice channel when you’re free. Friends in your server can see you’re around and instantly pop in to talk without having to call.</p>

			<h2>From a few to a fandom</h2>
			<p class="paragraphs"> Get a community of any size running with moderation tools and custom member access. Give members special powers, set up private channels, and more.</p>

			<h2>Reliable tech for staying close</h2>
			<p class="paragraphs"> Low-latency voice and video feels like you’re in the same room. Wave hello over video, watch friends stream their games, or gather up and have a drawing session with screen share. </p>
